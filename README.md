# A Random A@@ Item Lister

List things here: https://itsvictoroyedeji.github.io/item-lister/

This is 2nd thing I made on The Odin Project, a site that taught me how to code. You won't see the 1st thing I made because it's really bad.

Use this to list items you need (or want to do).

Main difference between this and your "notes" app on your phone: Once you complete the item on your list, you can easily delete them with a click of a button.

You can also search your list of items as well.

> Note: List does go away if you refresh the page. I'll fix that soon. So don't refresh after making your list!

> Note: Search search function doesn't work for mobile devices---yet. I'll into that as well.
